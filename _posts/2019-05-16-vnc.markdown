## Introduction
**V**irtual **N**etwork **C**omputing is a connection system that allows you to use your keyboard and mouse to interact with a graphical desktop environment on a remote server. This articles describe how to install and setup the VNC server on Ubuntu 18.04 on the [Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-nano-devkit) platform, using [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) as the desktop environment.

## Prerequisites
Install xfce4:
```
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies
```
Install TightVNC server:
```
sudo apt install tightvncserver
```
Run VNC server once to create a configuration file (automatically) and setup the password:
```
vncserver
```
PS: the configuration file is located in ```home/user_name/.vnc/xstartup```.  

Kill the VNC server:
```
vncserver -kill :1
```

Edit the configuration file (```home/user_name/.vnc/xstartup```):
```
#!/bin/bash
unset SESSION_MANAGER
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
```
Restart VNC server:
```
vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x720
```
You can now connect to the VNC server from other computer with the server address (e.g. 198.168.31.118:1). To check the IP of your VNC server, click the ''Connection Information'' on the network icon at the upper right corner of the screen.
